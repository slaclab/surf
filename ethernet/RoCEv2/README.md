# Hardware Implementation of RoCEv2 Engine
This folder contains files generated from Bluespec SystemVerilog (BSV) source code located in different repositories: [blue-rdma](https://github.com/datenlord/blue-rdma), [blue-crc](https://github.com/datenlord/blue-crc)

## Description
The verilog files in the `blue-rdma` and `blue-crc` folders represent a hardware implementation of the RoCEv2 engine and a iCRC calculation engine, respectively.
These files have been generated from a modified version of the BSV sources. The forked repo with the modifed version can be found [here](https://github.com/FilMarini/blue-rdma)

The modifications consists in:

* **Receiving Path Removed**: The RoCEv2 engine's receiving path as well as support for RDMA-Read operations has been entirely removed.

* **Resource Optimization**: By removing the receiving path, the core now consumes fewer hardware resources, allowing it to fit on smaller FPGAs.

* **Fixed settings**: the generated verilog has support for 1 PD, 1 QP, 2 CQ and 2 MR, in order to be as light as possible. To change these settings, the core needs to be re-generated from its original or modified repo

## License information
